<b><big>Chess Reader</big></b>

FreeCB is an interactive reader of chess books. Play through the lines in the book, or try your own, it's like having a chess board and a chess book in the palm of your hand.

The project was started by Ted Wong (tedwong@smallchess.com) and is currently being used by ForwardChess (http://www.forwardchess.com).
